This prject uses an alphavantage api client. If you want to use it, get your key at https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key and put it into a config.py file  in the alpha_client folder. config.py should look like 
apikey = "my API key"
symbols = ["symbol"]

I am hoping to assess the validity of a series of investment intuitions I have:

1. Technical price analysis can significantly improve investment returns
2. Trends exist
3. Funds have personalities
4. Historical returns are the best unbiased indicator of future performance
